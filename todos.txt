Things to go back and do in areas already completed:
Add more words to custom stemming if needed
Switch all the plotly plots to online and give them all names
In the stacked histograms, sort the colors from high to low instead of low to high
Update the scroll over wording in the plotly charts to include percentages
Show line on the histograms for where the mean and median occurs
Revenue, expenses, excess, net assets histograms: need to remove outliers or just log it (logging didn't work)
Working capital: need to take out outliers it is very clustered in the top left
Logarithm scale doesn't work for histograms - need to adjust
Worth looking at still: compensation, and relationship between funding efficiency and net assets / excess

NEED TO RESCRAPE FOR COMPENSATION
